# Power-BI-Project-University-Admissions-and-Shipping-Cost-Analysis
This repository contains a multi-part Power BI project covering advanced data transformations and visualizations across two domains: University Admissions and Retail Shipping Costs. The project demonstrates the use of Power BI’s Power Query Editor, Data Modeling, and Advanced Visualization features to extract insights and present them through interactive dashboards.
🧩 Problem Statement 1: Data Transformation for University Admissions Dashboard Objective: Perform comprehensive data transformations to model admission data for dashboard analysis. Dataset: USA State University Admissions Use Case: Analyze the trend of admissions into state universities using a clean and well-modeled dataset.

📈 Problem Statement 2: Advanced Visualizations on University Admissions Objective: Build interactive and insightful dashboards using expressions, DAX measures, and custom visuals.

Dashboards: Applications Analysis 
📈 Total Applications vs. Target Trend by State – Line chart showing actual vs. target over time. 
🗺️ Geo Map of Total Applications by State – Interactive map for regional comparison. 
📋 University Applications and Fund Table – Tabular matrix with filters for sorting and exporting. 
📊 % of Applications by Race – Donut/column chart displaying diversity distribution.

Universities Analysis 
🏆 Top 10 Universities by Applications – Bar chart showing leading institutions. 
🎓 Top 10 with/without Special Grants – Dual view highlighting grant impact. 
🔻 Bottom 10 Universities by Applications – Helps identify struggling institutions. 
💸 % Applications vs. Fund Allocations – Visualizing efficiency and reach of university funds.

Techniques Used: 
Custom DAX Measures (e.g., % Growth, Target Variance) 
Slicers for Year, State, and Race 
Bookmarks for switching between dashboards 
Drill-through pages and tooltip pages

🚚 Problem Statement 3: Shipping Cost Leakage Analysis (Superstore Sales) Objective: Detect anomalies and cost leakages using Top-Down and Bottom-Up Analytical Approaches.

Dataset: Superstore Sales

Top-Down Analysis Dashboards: 
📊 Shipping Costs by Order Priority – Clustered bar chart to isolate priority cost drivers. 
🔻 Shipping Costs by Shipping Mode – Funnel chart to analyze mode-wise cost contribution. 
🧍 Shipping Costs by Customers – Scatter plot to spot outlier customers with high shipping cost. 
📄 Transactional View – Detailed table to validate and audit transactions.

Bottom-Up Analysis Dashboards: 
🔁 Flipped Dashboards: Reused visuals with inverse drill direction (from transactional to aggregated). 
🌳 Replaced Transactional Table with Tree Map: Summarized costs per product-category-region. 
🧩 Switched Scatter Plot to Donut: Illustrated category-wise shipping cost concentration.

🧰 Tools and Technologies 
Power BI Desktop 
Power Query Editor 
DAX for Measures and Calculations 
Custom Visuals from Marketplace (Maps, Funnel, TreeMap) 
Bookmarks, Drillthroughs, and Tooltip Pages

✅ Outcomes 
Built end-to-end dashboards using advanced transformation techniques. 
Delivered actionable insights on university admission patterns and shipping inefficiencies. 
Demonstrated capability to integrate data engineering with business analytics using Power BI.
